# Rambling Blog

This is the source code for my personal blog, "Rambling Blog." It's built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MDX to provide a clean, fast, and developer-friendly platform for my notes, thoughts, and technical explorations.

### A Note on Development

This project was built as a learning exercise by a beginner in TypeScript, React, and Next.js. Many features are still in their early stages, and the implementation may not always follow best practices. I am actively working on improving the codebase and will be adding more features over time.

My development log is kept on the blog itself. It's currently written in Chinese, and you're welcome to check it out to follow my progress.
